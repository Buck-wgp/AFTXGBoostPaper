## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
Application = c("Beetle Extinction Risk", "Birth Weight Prediction", "Body Fat Mass",
          "CAO/ARO/AIO-04 DFS","Childhood Malnutrition","Head Circumference",
          "PRO-ACT ALSFRS","PRO-ACT OS"),
Source = c("Seibold et al. (2015)","Schild et al. (2008)","Garcia et al. (2005)","Rödel et al.  (2015)","Fenske et al. (2011)","Fredriks et al. (2000)","Küffner et al. (2015)","Seibold et al. (2017)"),
N      = c(1025,150,71,1153,24166,7040,1013,2711),
Y      = c("Ordered (6)","Continuous","Continuous","Survival (71%)","Continuous","Continuous","Ordered (50)","Survival (69%)"),
X      = c("(7,3)","(5, 0)","(9, 0)","(3, 15)","(6, 14)","(1, 0)","(43, 16)","(3, 16)"),
F_z    = c("expit","Φ","Φ","","","","",""),
Name_of_Folder = c("2015 - Seibold et al. - Beetle Extinction Risk","","2005 - Garcia et al. - Body Fat Mass","","2011 - Fenske et al. - Child Malnutritiion",""),
Status = c("Available","Not Available","Available","Not Available","Available","Not Available")
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
